# Welcome to Feesible

This project is an alpha version of an incoming website that will help you determine how much you'll spend on each type of transaction.

## How to start ?

Go to project directory
### `npm install`
I already included my api key from a test account, but it will run out. To use the project to your conveniance, use your own that you can create at https://data-beta.defipulse.com/
### `npm start`
Note : The api that I have is designed to work only on localhost:3000, change your port if the api request fails.
